# ITIL

ITIL is older than Java, Linux, Python and the WWW and has become part of basic common infrastructure of thought in the IT/IS space. If you are working in an enterprise, you will probably be slotting into an ITIL-defined role. 

One way or another, students will be using some forms-based workflow, ServiceNow being the most famous. It’s about as old as the students themselves, so again, almost part of the substrate of assumed knowledge. It maps onto ITIL very well, so I think as a teaching tool that it’s easier to get the students to use ServiceNow to see how the pieces fit together. Choosing ServiceNow here is a combination of a pedagogical choice (they’ve got some great resources) and a pragmatic-employability one (familiarity with it is expected in a lot of jobs they will be applying for).

Enterprise IT. How enterprises manage their IT, i.e. ITIL. interactions, incident management, major incident management, what L1, L2 and L3 support do, change management, problem & known error management; service level agreements and service level objectives; what a CMDB is.  Maybe also order management and purchase management? We could get several weeks’ worth of stuff from that, which is all cookie-cutter, already documented and easy to assess. We could set ourselves up so that next year we could propose that students do this unit and walk away with an ITILv4 certification.

# Sales-y roles

Talking about job roles in tech sales, that’s approximately 10% of roles. It’s also all the high-paying ones, and it’s also where the non-geek types often end up.

And for everyone not in a sales organisation, it’s really difficult to function in any IT role if you don’t know the difference between “I’m talking to a business development manager about their product” vs “I’m talking to the account executive about their product”. It’s kind of vendor management 101.

MSP/Vendor IT How technical pre-sales / post-sales is done & what a CRM is and does. We’re not giving them a business degree, but they need to understand the basics of what an account manager is, what an SDR/BDM does, where you would fit if you were in a pre-sales role or a customer success role. (If I had my dream: let’s also teach them Challenger Sales or the content from “To Sell is Human”. Setting these students up so that they can know whether they want to do a sales job will have enormous impacts on their employability and future earnings, since tech sales is so very, very well paid. If we get them to learn how CRMs are the backbone of IT in sales organisations, then we could get them to do some basic Salesforce stuff and again, resume gold.)

# DORA metrics, agile processes and Accelerate, Tech startup IT / IT within the software development team. 

This is one of the best-studied and clearest result we have. 

We should make sure that students understand what the DORA metrics are, and how you make a high performance team with few outages. (Basically, minimise the time between development and deployment.). We aren’t doing a whole devops course here, but we could kinda maybe create a simple CI/CD is. This then lets us compare different release management paradigms for software.

# Open source.

 There are organisations that must or should be using open source (e.g. the whole open source in government thing). We’re doing the Right Thing by the world by making sure that students know that this is an option. 

# Small business IT. 

Most of the Australian economy is small businesses, so why would we focus on enterprise? Small businesses have unique problems, but also unique opportunities because they don’t have to scale. I see so little research on this we would almost be at the cutting edge just talking about it. Things that I see that are relevant: purchasing of transparent and well-known technology becomes crucial, because you can be confident that there will be a break in handover between one support company and the next, with nothing being passed on. Everyone always has a nephew who’s good with computers: how do you leverage that? How are IT processes handled when IT-knowledgeable people only flit in and out of the organisation? A case study here would be to ask a small business (e.g. a doctor’s office or something like that) how their IT works. The point of the case study is partly to learn something and partly so that they get asked “while you’re here, do you think you could fix ____?” — to get them some income. ;-)
