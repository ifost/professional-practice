            Please review the content that has been added with this review. The goal is to
            provide useful information for a university-level professional practice unit for
            people without IT experience to learn how to operate in various kinds of IT organisation.
 
            Each slide should be about 100-200 words (i.e. about a minute to two minutes of talking).
           
            If you see that there is relevant content or topics that could be talked about that are missing, 
            suggest them. Suggest improvements to the conversational flow of the dialog. Identify where
            a concrete example would be helpful. Identify where humour could be added appropriately.
