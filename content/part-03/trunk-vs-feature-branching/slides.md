# Trunk-Based Development vs Feature Branching
*Balancing integration and isolation*

---

## Trunk-based development
- Single shared main line
- Small, frequent commits
- Feature toggles for unfinished work
- Encourages continuous integration

---

## Feature branching
- Isolated branches for each feature
- Merge via pull requests
- Allows longer-lived work
- Risk of merge conflicts and drift

---

## Choosing an approach
- Trunk-based boosts flow and feedback
- Feature branches aid code review
- Many teams blend both techniques

---

## Key takeaway
Continuous integration thrives on a healthy balance between shared trunk work and short-lived feature branches.
