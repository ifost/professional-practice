Speaker 1: At its core, a CI/CD pipeline takes every change and runs it through the same checklistâ€”build the code, test it thoroughly, then deploy it in a predictable way.
Speaker 2: Automating these steps removes guesswork and inconsistency. The trick is to build the application once, store that exact artifact, and promote it through test, staging, and production environments.
Speaker 1: Quick feedback loops are essential. If a test fails minutes after a commit, you can fix the issue before it grows.
Speaker 2: Security scans and quality gates slot neatly into this process as well, so new features never skip the basic health checks. The pipeline should become the trusted guardian that approves everything that ships.
