Speaker 1: Once a developer commits code, the pipeline springs into action. A clean environment spins up so any leftover files from previous builds can't cause trouble.
Speaker 2: The code is compiled or packaged, then a suite of automated tests checks that nothing obvious broke. If those tests pass, the same package moves on to a staging area where more realistic checks occur.
Speaker 1: Staging mirrors the production environment closely. It's where you might run smoke tests or manual reviews if needed.
Speaker 2: Only when everything looks good does the pipeline promote the very same build to production. That consistent flow—from commit to build to test to deploy—means you always know exactly what you're releasing.
