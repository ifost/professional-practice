Speaker 1: Picture manually copying files to dozens of servers after every tiny fix. It's slow, error-prone, and frankly a bit soul-crushing.

Speaker 1: Even non-technical teams appreciate the reliability. Instead of wondering if the latest version actually made it to the customer site, everyone can see the pipeline status in real time.
Speaker 2: Think of it like an assembly line in a factory. Once the pieces start moving, the machinery takes care of the rest, freeing people to focus on improving the product rather than shipping logistics.
