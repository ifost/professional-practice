# CI/CD Pipeline Design
*Automating delivery from commit to production*

---

## Why CI/CD?
- Manual deployments are slow and error-prone
- Automation ensures repeatable releases
- Quick feedback helps teams of any size
- Lets engineers focus on features, not shipping chores

---

## Core principles
- Automate build, test and deploy steps
- Build once, deploy many times
- Provide fast feedback on changes
- Include security and quality gates

---

## Implementation flow
- Trigger on source control events
- Build artifacts in a clean environment
- Run tests to validate changes
- Deploy progressively from dev to prod

---

## GitHub Actions example
- YAML workflow triggered on push
- Separate jobs for build, test and deploy
- Reusable actions and encrypted secrets

---

## Key takeaway
A wellâ€‘designed pipeline lets teams deliver code quickly and safely through automation and continuous feedback.
