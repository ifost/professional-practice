# Part 3 â€“ High-Velocity Delivery

This part introduces modern DevOps practices and SRE principles that enable organizations to deliver software rapidly while maintaining reliability and quality.

## Objectives

- Understand the four key DORA metrics and their significance in measuring DevOps performance.
- Explain the principles of trunk-based development and continuous integration/deployment.
- Describe SRE error budgets and how they balance reliability with feature velocity.
- Implement a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- Identify career paths in DevOps, SRE, and platform engineering roles.

## Key Topics

- DORA metrics: deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate, and mean time to recovery.
- Trunk-based development vs. feature branching strategies.
- Continuous integration and deployment pipeline design.
- SRE principles: error budgets, service level objectives, and reliability engineering.
- GitHub Actions workflow configuration and best practices.
- Platform engineering and infrastructure as code fundamentals.

## Job Roles Focus

This part emphasizes roles that bridge development and operations:

- **DevOps Engineer**: Builds and maintains CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation
- **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)**: Focuses on system reliability, monitoring, and incident response
- **Platform Engineer**: Creates developer tooling and internal platforms
- **Release Engineer**: Manages software releases and deployment processes
- **Cloud Engineer**: Designs and maintains cloud infrastructure and services

Career progression typically flows from junior developer or sysadmin roles into specialized DevOps/SRE positions, with senior roles leading platform strategy and engineering culture transformation.

## Hands-on Component

Students will build a "hello-world" CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, intentionally inject a failure, and collect baseline metrics for deployment lead time and mean time to recovery. This provides practical experience with the tools and concepts covered in the theoretical content.
