# Error Budgets & SLOs
*Balancing reliability and feature velocity*

---

## Service level objectives
- Define target reliability percentages
- Measure user-facing performance
- Clarify what "good enough" looks like

---

## Error budgets
- Difference between perfect reliability and the SLO
- Consumed as incidents and downtime occur
- Helps prioritize fixes vs new features

---

## Using error budgets
- Track burn rate over time
- Slow releases when the budget runs low
- Foster data-driven reliability conversations

---

## Key takeaway
Error budgets turn SLOs into actionable limits on risk, guiding when to push forward or stabilize.
