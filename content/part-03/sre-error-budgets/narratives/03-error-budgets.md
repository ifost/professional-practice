Speaker 1: An error budget is the small slice of allowable failure built into an SLO. If our target is 99.9% uptime, that gives us about forty minutes of downtime each month.
Speaker 2: As outages or performance issues occur, we "spend" that budget. When it's gone, engineering focuses on reliability work instead of shipping new features.
Speaker 1: This approach keeps everyone aligned. Product managers see how instability eats into development time, while engineers know exactly when to slow their release pace.
