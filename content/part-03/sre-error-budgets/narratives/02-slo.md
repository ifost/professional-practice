Speaker 1: A service level objective is basically a reliability target, like "respond to user requests within two seconds 99% of the time." It sets clear expectations.
Speaker 2: For non-technical folks, think of an SLO as a promise to customers. If we hit that goal, users stay happy. If we miss it, they notice glitches or slow pages.
Speaker 1: We monitor these objectives continuously so we know if the service is drifting away from the acceptable range before customers complain.
