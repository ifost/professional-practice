# Metrics & Reporting Dashboards
*Turning raw data into actionable insight*

---

## Why metrics matter
- Validate that processes are working as designed
- Spot bottlenecks before they become incidents
- Provide evidence for continual-improvement discussions

---

## Choosing the right KPIs
- Align with customer value rather than gut feel
- Balance leading and lagging indicators
- Keep the list short â€“ focus drives behaviour

---

## Building the dashboard
- Combine data from ITSM, monitoring and CMDB sources
- Use traffic-light visuals for quick scanning
- Let stakeholders drill down for root-cause context

---

## Storytelling with data
- Frame trends in plain language, not just charts
- Celebrate wins and highlight risks
- Close the loop: feed insights back into the service value chain

---

## From reports to action
- Schedule regular review rituals (daily stand-up, weekly ops review)
- Tie improvement tasks to owners and due dates
- Track progress to prove the dashboard drives change
