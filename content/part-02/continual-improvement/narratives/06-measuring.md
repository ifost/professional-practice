Speaker 1: You can't improve what you don't measure. But measuring improvement success goes beyond just technical metrics - you need to look at the whole picture.

Speaker 2: Service performance metrics are the obvious starting point. Are your incidents being resolved faster? Are there fewer outages? Is system availability improving? These operational metrics show if your processes are working better.

Speaker 1: Customer satisfaction scores tell you if your improvements actually matter to users. Sometimes technical improvements don't translate to better user experience, and sometimes small changes make a huge difference to customer happiness.

Speaker 2: Employee engagement levels are crucial but often overlooked. Are your team members more motivated? Do they feel empowered to make improvements? Happy employees deliver better service, so this is a leading indicator of future success.

Speaker 1: Finally, business value delivered is the ultimate measure. Are your improvements helping the organization achieve its goals? Are IT services enabling new business capabilities? This connects your technical work to real business outcomes.
