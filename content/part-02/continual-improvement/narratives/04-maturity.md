Speaker 1: Maturity models are like a GPS for your improvement journey. They help you figure out where you are now and chart a path to where you want to be.

Speaker 2: Think of it like learning to drive. You start with basic skills like steering and braking, then progress to parallel parking, and eventually to driving in complex traffic. Each level builds on the previous one.

Speaker 1: In IT service management, maturity models assess how well your organization manages services. A level one organization might be reactive, fixing things as they break. A level five organization predicts and prevents problems before they impact users.

Speaker 2: The key insight is that you can't skip levels. You need solid incident management before you can do effective problem management. You need good change control before you can implement continuous deployment. It's about building capability progressively.
