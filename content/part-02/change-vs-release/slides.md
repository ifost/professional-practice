# Change Enablement vs Release Management
*Keeping changes safe while shipping fast*

## Change enablement
- Assess risk before work starts
- Require approvals for significant changes
- Protect production stability

---

## Release management
- Package changes for deployment
- Coordinate release windows
- Communicate what is shipping

---

## Working together
- Change enablement gates the work
- Release management plans the rollout
- Both aim for smooth, reliable updates
