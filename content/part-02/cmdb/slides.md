title: Building and Maintaining a CMDB

# Building and Maintaining a Configuration Management Database
*Why an accurate inventory powers ITIL*

---

## What is a CMDB?
- Central inventory of systems and relationships
- Example CIs: servers, network gear, SaaS applications
- Tracks versions, owners and dependencies
- Supports reliable ITIL processes

---

## Building the CMDB
- Identify key configuration items
- Populate attributes from trusted sources
- Map relationships between CIs

---

## Change management integration
- Reference affected CIs in each change request
- Update the CMDB after approved changes
- Link discovery results to spot differences between approved and observed state

---

## Maintaining accuracy
- Update records as changes happen
- Automate discovery where possible
- Compare observed state to approved CMDB records
- Schedule audits to clean up gaps

---

## When records and reality differ
- Unauthorized changes bypass change control
- Manual tweaks create configuration drift
- Discovery finds devices not in the CMDB
- Retired assets linger as phantom entries

---

## Why it matters
- Speeds up incident and change analysis
- Reduces risk of unknown dependencies
- Provides a single source of truth
