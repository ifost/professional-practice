## Short Answer Questions

### 11. SLA Components
**Question:** List three essential components that should be included in any SLA and briefly explain why each is important.

**Sample Answer:**
- **Service description**: Clearly defines what service is being provided to avoid misunderstandings
- **Performance targets**: Specific, measurable criteria (e.g., 99.5% uptime, 4-hour response time) that set expectations
- **Consequences**: What happens when targets are not met (penalties, credits, remediation actions)

### 12. Change Advisory Board (CAB)
**Question:** Explain the role of a Change Advisory Board and identify two types of changes that typically would NOT require CAB approval.

**Sample Answer:**
The CAB reviews and authorizes changes to reduce risk and ensure proper impact assessment. Two types that typically bypass CAB:
- **Standard changes**: Pre-approved, low-risk changes with established procedures (e.g., password resets, routine patches)
- **Emergency changes**: Critical fixes needed immediately to restore service, reviewed post-implementation

### 13. Problem vs Incident
**Question:** A server crashes every Tuesday at 2 PM, causing a 30-minute outage. Explain the difference between how this would be handled by incident management versus problem management.

**Sample Answer:**
- **Incident management**: Focuses on restoring service quickly each Tuesday - restarting the server, communicating with users, documenting the outage
- **Problem management**: Investigates why the server crashes every Tuesday - analyzing logs, identifying root cause (perhaps a scheduled backup job), implementing a permanent fix

### 14. CMDB Relationships
**Question:** Describe two types of relationships you might find in a CMDB and give an example of each.

**Sample Answer:**
- **Dependency relationships**: Shows what depends on what (e.g., Web Application depends on Database Server)
- **Composition relationships**: Shows what is part of what (e.g., Hard Drive is part of Physical Server)

### 15. Continual Improvement Measurement
**Question:** You're implementing a continual improvement program. Explain how you would measure the effectiveness of the program itself (not just the processes being improved).

**Sample Answer:**
- **Number of improvements implemented**: Track quantity of successful changes
- **Time to implement improvements**: Measure efficiency of the improvement process
- **ROI of improvements**: Calculate business value generated vs. resources invested
- **Employee engagement**: Survey staff participation and satisfaction with improvement activities

## Scenario-Based Questions

### 16. SLA Negotiation Scenario
**Question:** A client wants 99.99% uptime (4.32 minutes downtime per month) but only wants to pay for basic support. How would you handle this situation?

**Sample Answer:**
- Explain the cost implications of 99.99% uptime (redundant systems, 24/7 monitoring, faster response times)
- Offer tiered options: basic support with 99.5% uptime, premium support with 99.99%
- Discuss the client's actual business needs - do they really need 99.99% or would 99.5% suffice?
- Consider scheduled maintenance windows that don't count against availability

### 17. Change Management Scenario
**Question:** A critical security patch needs to be deployed to all servers within 72 hours. The normal change process takes 5 days. How would you handle this?

**Sample Answer:**
- Classify as emergency change due to security implications
- Convene emergency CAB or get approval from designated change manager
- Implement with accelerated testing in non-production environment
- Plan for rollback procedure in case of issues
- Document all decisions and review post-implementation
- Update standard change procedures if this type of situation is common

### 18. Problem Management Scenario
**Question:** Users report slow network performance every day between 2-4 PM. Restarting the network switch temporarily fixes it. How would you approach this as a problem manager?

**Sample Answer:**
- Gather data: network monitoring logs, usage patterns, switch performance metrics
- Identify trends: consistent timing suggests scheduled processes or peak usage
- Investigate root causes: network capacity, switch configuration, specific applications
- Implement monitoring during peak times to capture detailed performance data
- Develop permanent solution: upgrade switch, optimize network configuration, or load balancing
- Create preventive measures to avoid recurrence
