Speaker 1: Once an incident is logged, watch the state field. It starts as New, then moves to In Progress when someone picks it up. If we need more information, we set it to Awaiting Info, which pings the requester automatically.

Speaker 2: When the issue is fixed, change the state to Resolved. After the user confirms, we mark it Closed. Every update is tracked in the Activity log, forming a complete audit trail. This visual flow mirrors the textbook ITIL lifecycle, so you can see each handoff and decision point.
