Speaker 2: [reflective] The real takeaway is that ITIL 4 gives you a sturdy framework for managing technology services. It's like having a trusty toolkit when something breaksâ€”you don't have to guess which wrench fits.

Speaker 1: [warm] As you explore the rest of this course, keep that toolkit analogy in mind. You won't memorise every tool on day one, but knowing they exist means you're ready for whatever problems pop up.

Speaker 2: [smiling] So buckle up and enjoy the ride. The better you understand ITIL now, the easier every other topic will become.
