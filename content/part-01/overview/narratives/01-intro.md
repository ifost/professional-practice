Speaker 1: [friendly] Welcome to our quick tour of ITIL 4. Think of this first slide as the stage curtain rising. Behind it lies a set of practices that guide how large organisations deliver tech support.

Speaker 2: [cheerful] If you're new to the scene, picture ITIL like a city's traffic systemâ€”lanes, signs and intersections that keep everything flowing. Without it, we'd have gridlock every time an incident pops up.

Speaker 1: [light-hearted] We'll stick to the essentials, sprinkling in some humour so you won't nod off. By the end of this course you'll see why ITIL lingo is your ticket to a smoother IT career.
