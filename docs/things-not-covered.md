# Additional Topics Not Yet Planned

The conversation highlighted several content areas missing from the current syllabus:

- **Professional communication and teamwork skills.** The repo contains no modules on workplace communication, documentation practices, or collaboration tools.
- **Security fundamentals and compliance frameworks.** Outside of a brief note about “security trade-offs” in small-biz IT, there is no dedicated coverage of cybersecurity principles or risk management.
- **Project management methods.** The planned material touches on DevOps and continuous delivery, but classic project management frameworks (Agile, Waterfall) or stakeholder management are absent.
- **Career development and job-seeking strategies.** While the course aims to improve employability, there are no sessions on CV/resumé preparation, interview practice, or networking.
- **Professional ethics beyond open-source considerations.** The learning objective mentions ethics broadly, yet there is no specific module on professional codes of conduct or wider ethical decision-making in IT.
