# Quote from Jo Visser

As IT infrastructures became more complicated, the problem of supporting these infrastructures grew exponentially and somewhere in the early 2000s that curve overtook my personal knowledge curve. Since then I have been approximately as helpless as the average n00b when it comes down supporting myself in case of technical trouble. Fortunately, all the companies I worked for since then (an elite group, I will happily point out) kept up by employing excellent tech support peopleâ€¦

The tech support people I deal with these days are nothing short of amazing. Look at the incredibly complicated infrastructure they support: Thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of laptops and portable devices, under some form of enterprise control, with VPNs, certificates, wireless networks, Yubi keys, mobile device management, single sign on, and dozens of applications, some local, some on the cloud, all more or less integrated.

People are breaking hardware, losing hardware, or forgetting hardware at home. Certificates go missing, passwords are forgotten, application settings magically get altered or disappear entirely. Printers stop working, DHCP pools get exhausted, new applications need to be integrated. People bring their own hardware to the office, install their own applications, want to use a USB key, get kicked out of Slack, want to restore some files, or need help getting something, anything, to work.

The complexity of modern office IT infrastructure is simply mind boggling and, as I wrote above, understanding it all requires way more time than I have available. So when I have a problem, I am super happy to be able to go to an excellent IT support function.
