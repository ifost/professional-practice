# Narrative Guidelines

The narrative files under `content/**/` are the verbatim scripts fed into the text-to-speech engine. Each slide normally runs for about a minute, so aim for roughly one hundred words per slide, written in full sentences.

Because every line is spoken, **do not include headings or bullet points**. Instead, save a separate `.md` file for each slide in a `narratives/` folder next to the slide deck. Name them `01.md`, `02.md` and so on to match the slide order.

You may indicate delivery style with bracketed notes, e.g. `[excitedly]`, and split the script between "Speaker 1" and "Speaker 2" if you want a dialog. Keep the tone friendly and feel free to use analogies, humour and real-world examples to hold the listener's attention.
